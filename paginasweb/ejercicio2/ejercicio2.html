    <h1>Space exploration</h1>

    <h2>Targets of exploration</h2>
    <p>
      Starting in the <b>mid-20th</b> century probes and then human mission were
      sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent
      throughout the known Solar system, and into Solar orbit. Unmanned
      spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,
      and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft,
      <small>Voyager 1 and 2</small> traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun
      distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have
      left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the
      Galaxy by the Sun's solar wind.

    <h3><strong>The Sun</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <b>The Sun</b> is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the
      atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the
      solar wind and infrared and <strong>radiations</strong> that cannot reach
      Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather, which can affect
      power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and
      even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to
      observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount, have been
      launched and <del>still others have had solar</del> observation as a
      secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, will approach
      the Sun to within 1/8th the orbit of Mercury.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Mercury</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <b>Mercury</b> remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets. As
      of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and <i>MESSENGER</i> missions have been the
      only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. MESSENGER
      entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the
      observations <ins>made by Mariner 10 in 1975</ins> (Munsell, 2006b).
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Venus</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <b>Venus</b> was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander
      missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the
      Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet
      Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the
      1961 Venera 1, though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to
      successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other
      flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus
      flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial
      bodies. <em>In 1967 Venera 4</em> became the first probe to enter and
      directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the
      first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had
      been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which
      provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975 with the
      Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been
      sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface
      of Venus using <sub> radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.</sub>
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Earth</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand
      <strong>Earth</strong>
      as a celestial object in its own right. Orbital missions can provide data
      for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely
      <mark>ground-based point of reference.</mark> For example, the existence
      of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the
      United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1. These belts contain
      radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders
      construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical.
      Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth
      observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth
      from a space based perspective. These satellites have significantly
      contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena.
      For instance, the
      <sup>hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial</sup>
      satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have
      allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations
      that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.
